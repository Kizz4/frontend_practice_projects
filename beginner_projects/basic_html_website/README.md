# Basic HTML Website

This project is part of the [Frontend Projects Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/frontend/projects) for beginners.  
And the [link](https://roadmap.sh/projects/basic-html-website) of the project himself.

The goal of this project is to teach you how to structure a website using HTML, focusing on key sections like the header, navigation, main content, and footer. Styling will be handled in a later project.

By completing this project, you'll gain a solid understanding of how to organize content semantically across multiple pages, ensuring your site is accessible and ready for future enhancements.
